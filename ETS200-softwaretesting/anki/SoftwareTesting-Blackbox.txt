Define <b>Black box </b>testing	<div>When the tester is using the black box approach, the software under test is considered a opaque box. There is no knowledge of its inner structure (i.e. how it works). The tester only knows what it does.</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Definition (ISTQB): black box testing is testing, either functional or non-functional, without reference to the internal structure of the component or system.</i></div>	
To what levels is <b>Black box </b>applicable?	Black box testing is applicable in integration testing, system testing and acceptance testing.

Explain <b>Random Testing</b>	Random testing is when the tester randomly selects input from the domain. Random testing may save some of the time and effort that more thoughful test input selection methods require. However, according to many testing experts, selecting inputs ranmodly has very little chance of producing an effective set of test data.	
Explain <b>Equivalence Class Partioning</b>	Equivalence Class partioning involves dividing (i.e. to partition) a set of test conditions into groups or sets that can be considered the same (i.e. the system should handle them equivalentnly). We then only test one condition from each group, since all conditions should be treated in the same way by the system anyway. If one condition in a partion works, we assume all of the conditions in that partion will work.	
Explain <b>Boundary Value Analysis</b>	In Boundary value analysis the value that are just inside/outside the boundaries (partions) are tested. That includes both valid boundaries and invalid boundaries. BVA used together with Equivalence Class Partitioning usually gives a very effective test set.	
Explain <b>Error Guessing</b>	"Error guessing is where the devolper uses his experience and intuition to try to find where defects may lurk in the code. The tester/developer might have past experience of similar code and can sometime make an educated ""guess"" as to which types of defects may be present and design test cases to reveal them."	
Mention some advantages of <b>black box </b>testing	<div>- Testing are done from a user's point of view and will help in exposing discrepancies in the specification.</div><div><br /></div><div>- Tester need not know programming languages or how the software has been implemented.</div><div><br /></div><div>- Tests can be conducted by a body independent from the developers, allowing for an objective perspective and the avoidance of developer-bias.</div><div><br /></div><div>- Test cases can be designed as soon as the specifications are complete.</div>	
Mention some disadvantages of <b>black box</b>&nbsp;testing	<div>- Only a small number of possible inputs can be tested and many program paths will be left untested.</div><div><br /></div><div>- Without clear specification, which is the situation in many projects, test cases will be difficult to design.</div><div><br /></div><div>- Tests can be redundant if the software designer/developer has already run a test case.</div>
