Explain <b>White box</b>&nbsp;testing	White box focuses on the inner structure of the software to be tested.	
Mention some <b>advantages</b> of white box testing&nbsp;	<div>- Testing can be commenced at an earlier stage. One need not to wait for the GUI to be available.</div><div><br /></div><div>- Testing is more thorough, with the possibility of covering most paths.</div>	
Mention some <b>disadvantages</b>&nbsp;of white box testing&nbsp;	<div>- Since tests can be very complex, highly skilled resources are required, with thorough knowledge of programming and implementation.</div><div><br /></div><div>- Test script maintenance can be a burden if the implementation changes too frequently.</div><div><br /></div><div>- Since this method of testing is closely tied with the application being tested, tools to cater to every kind of implementation/platform may not be readily available.</div>	
Explain <b>function </b>coverage	Measures if each function (or subroutine) in the program has been called	
Explain <b>Statement Coverage</b>	Measures if each statement in the program has been executed	
Explain <b>decision/branch coverage</b>	Measures if each branch of each control structure has been executed.<div><br /></div><div>For example, given an <i>if </i>statement, have both the <i>true</i>&nbsp;and <i>false</i>&nbsp;branches been executed? Another way of saying this is, has every <i>edge</i>&nbsp;been executed?</div>	
Explain <b>condition coverage</b>	Measures if each boolean sub-expression has evaluated to both <i>true</i>&nbsp;and <i>false</i>	
How do you calculate McCabes Cyclomatic Complexity?	M = E - N + 2P<div><br /></div><div>E is edges.</div><div>N is nodes.</div><div>P is <i>connected components</i>&nbsp;(often 1 which gives M = E-N+2)</div><div><br /></div>	
What is Cyclomatic Complexity used for?	Cyclomatic Complexity is a software measurment that is used to indicate the complexity of a program.<div><div><br /></div><div>Cyclomatic complexity for a flow graph gives an approximation (usually an upper limit) of the number of tests needed to achieve branch (decision) coverage.</div><div>Cyclomatic complexity can also be used as a tool combined with previous experience and project data to approximate the testing time and resources required to test a software module.</div></div>	
To what level is&nbsp;<b>white box</b>&nbsp;applicable?	White box testing is applicable in unit testing, integration testing and system testing. White box testing is mainly used in unit testing.
