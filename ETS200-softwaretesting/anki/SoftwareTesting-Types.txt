Define some <b>Types</b>&nbsp;of software testing	- Regression testing<div><br /></div><div>- Smoke testing</div><div><br /></div><div>- Usability testing</div><div><br /></div><div>- Security testing</div><div><br /></div>	
Explain <b>Regression Testing</b>	<div>Regression testing is a type of software testing that intends to ensure that <b>changes</b> (enhancements or defect fixes) to the software have not adversely affected it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Any code change have a likelihood af impacting functionalities that are not directly associated with the code currentrly being changed. Therefore it is important to perform regression testing to ensure that fixing one thing has not broken another thing.</div><div><br /></div><div>During regression testing new test cases are not created. Previously created test cases are re-executed.</div>	
On what kind of levels are <b>regression testing</b>&nbsp;used?	Regression testing can be performed during any level of testing (Unit, Integration, System or Acceptance) but it is <b>mostly</b> relevant during <b>System Testing</b>.	
Explain <b>Smoke Testing</b>	<div>The term smoke testing is said to come from hardware testing, where the device passed the test if it did not catch fire (or smoked) the first time it was turned on.</div><div><br /></div><div>Smoke testing (also known as <i>build verification testing</i>) is a type of software testing that comprises of a non-exhausitve set of test that aim to ensure that the most important functions work. The result of this test is used to decide if a build is stable enough to proceed with further testing.</div><div><br /></div><div>Smoke testing cover most of the major functions but none of them in depth.</div>	
What are some advantages of <b>Smoke Testing?</b>	<div>- It exposes integration issues</div><div><br /></div><div>- It uncovers problems early</div><div><br /></div><div>- It provides some level of confidence that changes to the software have not adversely affected major areas (the areas covered by smoke testing, of course).</div>	
To what levels are smoke testing applicable to?	<div>- Integration Testing</div><div><br /></div><div>- System Testing</div><div><br /></div><div>- Acceptance Testing</div>	
Explain <b>Usability Testing</b>	<div>Usability testing is done from an end-user's perspective to determine if the system is easily usable.</div><div><br /></div><div>Definition (ISTQB):<i> usability testing is testing to determine the extent to which the software product is understood, easy to learn, easy to operate and attractive to the users under specified conditions.</i></div><div><br /></div>	
To what levels are Usability testing applicable to?	Levels that are applicable to usability testing is System Testing and Acceptance Testing.	
Explain <b>Security Testing</b>	<div>Security Testing is a type of software testing that intends to uncover vulnerabilities of the system and determine that its data and resources are protected from possible intruders.</div><div><br /></div>	
Explain <b>Functional Testing</b>	In function testing the software is tested against the functional requirements/specification. During functional testing black box testing is used.<div><br /></div>	
To what levels are Functional testing used?	Functional testing is normally performed during the levels of System Testing and Acceptance Testing.	
Explain <b>Performance Testing</b>	Performance Testing intends to determine how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a certain load.	
Explain <b>Compliance Testing</b>	Compliance testing (also knows as conformance testing, regulation testing, standards testing) is a type of testing to determine the compliance with internal or external standards.
