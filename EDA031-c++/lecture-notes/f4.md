# Föreläsning 4
Notes from the lecture notes.

## The Arrow Operator
To access a member in an objcet the dot operator is used. If you have a pointer
to the object you use the arrow operator.

```cpp
Point p1(1, 2);
Point* p = new Point(1, 2);
double xLoc1 = p1.getX();
double xLoc2 = p2->getX();
```

Instead of using the arrow operator you could first dereference the pointer
to get the objcet pointed to, then use the dot operator: 
`double xLoc2 = (*p).getX();`. This is difficult to read and shouldn't be 
used.

## sizeof Operator
`sizeof(type name)` returns the size of an object of the type, in character
units. `sizeof(expression)` returns the size of the result type of the 
expression. 

```cpp
int a[5];
cout << sizeof(int) << endl;    // 4 (if an int has 4 bytes)
cout << sizeof(a) << endl;      // 20 (4 * 5)
```

## Type Conversions
In Java, we need to use an explicit cast if for instance cast from a `double`
 to an `int`:

 ```java
 double d = 35;   // d == 35.0; implicit
 d = 35.67;
 int x = (int) d;   // x == 35; explicit
 ```

In C++, there are **implicit** conversions in both directions.

```cpp
d = 35.67;
int x = d;    // x == 35; implicit
```
We should use an **explicit** cast instead:

```cpp
int x = static_cast<int>(d);
```

There are other types of cast in cpp, such as `dynamic_cast<type>(pointer)`,
 `const_cast<type>(variable)` and `reinterpret_cast<type>(expr)`.

 We can also use the same style of casting as in Java (using `int` as in the 
 above example) but this **should not** be used in C++.

## Local Static Variables
In C++, both class attributes and functions may have static variables.
Such a variable is craeted on the first call of the function, and its value is 
remembered between syccessive calls. For instance, we can count the number 
of calls to a function:

```cpp
void f() {
  static int counter = 0;
  counter++;
  ...
}

```

## Argument Passing
Arguments to functions are by default passed by value, as in Java. This means
 that the values of the argument is computed and copied to the function, and
  that an assignment to the formal parameter does not affect the argument.

If we do wish to change the value of an argument, we must **pass by reference**.

```cpp
void swap(int& v1, int& v2) {
  int tmp = v2;
  v2 = v1;
  v1 = tmp;
}

int main() {
  int i = 20;
  int j = 10;
  swap(i, j);
}
```

We also use pass by reference when we have a large object that we don't wish to 
copy on each call. Then we must use const (if we don't wish to modify the
 object). Without const we could inadvertently change the state of the object
  in the function.

```cpp
bool isShorter(const string& s1, const string& s2) {
  return s1.size() < s2.size();
}

```

## Parameters - Pointer or Reference
If a program uses stack-allocated objects (which should be the normal case),
write functions with reference parameters. if the program must use heap-
allocated objects, write function with pointer parameters.

```cpp
void refPrint(const Point& p) {
  cout << p.getX() << " " << p.getY() << endl;
}
void ptrPrint(const Point* p) {
  cout << p->getX() << " " << p->getY() << endl;
}
void f() {
  Point p1(10, 20);
  Point* pptr = new Point(30, 40);
  refPrint(p1); // normal usage
  ptrPrint(pptr); // also normal usage
  ...
  delete pptr;
}
```

## Chapter 5

### Null statement

A null statement is a single semicolon, `;`. It's useful where the language 
requires a statement but the program's logic doesn't. Such usage is common
when a loop's work can be done within its condition. For example¨we might want
to read an input stream, ignoring everything we read until we encounter a
particular value:

```
// read until we hit end-of-file or find an input equal to sought
while (cin >> s && s != sought)
  ;   // null statement
```

**Best Practices:** Null statement should be commented. That way anyone reading
the code can see that the statement was omitted intentionally.

### Switch Statement
The switch statement provides a convenient way of selecting among a (possibly 
large) number of fixed alternatives. 

```
...
switch (ch) {
  case 'a':
    ++aCount;
    break;
  case 'e':
    ++eCount;
    break;
  default:
    ++otherCount;
    break;
}

```

**Best Practices**: Omitting a break at the end of a `case` happens rarely. If
you do omit a `break`, include a comment explaining the logic.

**Best Practices**: Although it is not necesarry to include a `break` after the
last label of a `switch`, the safest course is to provide one. That way, if
an additional `case` is added later, the `break` is already in place.

**Best Practices**: It can be useful to define a `default` label even if there 
is no work for the `default` case. Defining an empty `default` section
indicates to subsequent readers that the case was considered.

### Range For
C++11 introduces a simpler `for` statement that can be used to iterate through
the elements of a container or other sequence. The syntatic form of the 
**range for** statement is:

```
for (declaration : expression)
    statement
```

`expression` must represent a sequence, such as an array, `vector` or `string`.

`declaration` defines a variable. It must be possible to convert each element 
of the sequence to the variable's type. The easiest way to ensure that the 
types match is to use the `auto` type specifier. That way the compiler will 
deduce the types for us.

Example:

```
vector<int> v = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
for (auto &r : )
  r *= 2;
```

Because we want to change the value of the element in `v` we declare `r` as
a reference. 

A **range for** is defined in terms of the equivalent traditional `for`:

```
for (auto beg = v.begin(), end = v.end(); beg != end; ++beg) {
  auto &r = *beg;
  r *= 2;
}

```

Since the value of `end()` is cached, we cannot use a range for to add 
(or remove) elements to a vector (or other container). If we do, the value of
`end` might be invalid.

### Jump statements
Jump statements interrupt the flow of execution. C++ offers four jumps,
`break`, `continue`, `goto` and `return` (`return` is described in
chapter 6).

#### break statement
The **break** statement terminates the nearest enclosing `while, do while, for`
or `switch` statement. Execution resumes at the statement immediately following
the terminated statement.

#### continue statement
A **continue** statement terminates the current iteration of the nearest 
enclosing loop and immediately begins the next iteration. A `continue` can
appear only inside a `for, while` or `do while` loop. Like the `break`
statement, a `continue` inside a nested loop affects only the nearest
enclosing loop.

#### goto statement
A **goto** statement provides an unconditional jump from the `goto` to another
statement in the same function.

**Best Practises**: Programs should **not** use `goto`s. `goto`s make programs
hard to understand and hard to modify.
